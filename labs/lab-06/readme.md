This lab was fun. I feel like we got a deeper look into Javascript. For this lab we built a quiz game using GET requests, DOM, and events. The most difficult part of this lab was keeping up with all of the different pages that were a part of it. I think that if we use this route in our Capstone project, it might be a bit challenging. Overall, if I could change anything, it would be to fix whatever it is that is making you have to click multiple times on the answer before it actually accepts it and moves you to the next screen.
