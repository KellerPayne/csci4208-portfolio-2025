What. A. Beast. This was a huge lab. We created a database. We learned about data persistence, LocalStorage API, JsonBin, and Document DB. It was a lot to take in. It is going to be a lot to remember. And I believe this is going to be something that we will have to implement with our Capstone project. I had a difficult time keeping up with all of the different methods and how they interacted with the different classes. The comments in the code were absolutely necessary for me to keep up with and understand what was going on at any given time. Seeing this code was quite enlightening, as I'm also taking 4125. Seeing what all goes into database creation is intense. Thank goodness we have SQL. I don't know if I would change anything about this one. I think I would have to be a database expert to be able to point at one specific thing in here and say, "I want to change that."
