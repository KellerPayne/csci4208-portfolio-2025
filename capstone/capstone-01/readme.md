## Summary (what we produced)
- <Idea Summary:>

<For our capstone project, we would like to create a quiz game to display on the screens throughout the computer science department. This quiz game will contain content from prerequisite computer science courses like 1581, 2120, and 2125. We chose these courses specifically since computer science majors must pass them to be able to move forward in the degree path. Additional courses can be added upon request. As part of this quiz game, we will keep a leaderboard, where people can create their own usernames and their point values will be stored and displayed on the screens. We hope that this will help facilitate some sort of competitive experience among the student population, and, in turn, increase engagement and student performance in these prerequisite classes.>
