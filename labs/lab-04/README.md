For this lab, we created a number guessing game. The goal was to correctly guess a number between 0 and 999 within a set number of tries. We used javascript in conjunction with DOM to make it. Overall, it was as quick lab that was enjoyable. I feel like I understand the basics of Javascript after doing it. The most difficult part of the lab was that my brain kept wanting to go to Java and type something like 'public void guessNumber()' when writing the functions. I liked how we were able to change the images with the javascript code, which would have been helpful to know in the first project with the interactive story game. If I would improve anythying, it would be to give maybe 15 attempts instead of 10.
