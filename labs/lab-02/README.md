CSS wasn't very difficult to learn, like HTML. The CSS makes styling of the HTML tags possible. The most difficult aspect of CSS is remembering that class selectors begin with a dot and id selectors begin with a hashtag. It was also nice to be able to import and use fonts from Google to get away from the boilerplate, generic Chrome fonts. Overall, CSS is definitely useful, and it was quite helpful when I created my own personal portfolio page a few years ago! Although, that CSS code definitely isn't as well organized and structured as this CSS code.
