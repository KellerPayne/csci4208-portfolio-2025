For lab-05, we built a game using HTML and Javascript. This was a long lab, but an interesting one. We utilized some super() calls within constructors, which is something that I didn't expect to see outside of Java. The most tricky part was while testing different parts of it, I had to go in and clear the cache before I would see the changes in the game take effect. If there were anything about the game I would improve, it would be to limit the number of enemy projectiles. It made it difficult to play at times when the screen was full of enemies and their projectiles.
