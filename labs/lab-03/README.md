Bootstrap was just a little bit more challenging to learn than CSS. There is a lot more to it than simple HTML and CSS coding. There are a lot more pieces that you have to remember and keep track of. But it is totally worth it. This past year when I worked on my best friend's wedding website through GitHub, I was able to implement Bootstrap carousels and jumbotrons. But it took me so long to get it all to work right that I almost gave up. When I was finally able to keep it all straight and work it out, she and I were both impressed with how professional the webpage looked!
